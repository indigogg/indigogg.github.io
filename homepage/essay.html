        <h1>Panaderia</h1>
        <p>I don’t even remember the first time I walked into a Pandaria. I have no recollection of the first time I smelled sweet pondulse come out of the oven steaming with hot air, the first time I found myself in a small room surrounded by trays upon trays of different Mexican treats. Even though I’ve seen him do it countless times, I can’t think back to the first time I’ve ever watched my dad pick up a tray and tongs, asking me, “which one should we pick first?” I’ve grown up looking forward to Saturday mornings when we get in the car journeying to three or four different bakeries, accumulating bags upon bags of my favorite breakfast treats. Although the concept of breakfast treats may seem small and unimportant, and may seem like a normal family tradition, I think that normality is what makes these mornings so important to me. My dad was able to take something so big and monumental to his Mexican-American family, Mexican food, and show me that it can be a normal part of my life.<p>
        <p>Although I don’t remember the first time I walked into a Pandaria, a story my parents tell frequently, a story that I knew by heart by the time I was 7, is a story about a trip we took to a Pandaria when I was only one or two. As my mom tells it, or sometimes my dad, it was the three of us plus my Abuelita, when we went to go buy Pondulse for breakfast. We went to our favorite Pandaria, because the Panaderias in LA are always better; about a 45 minute drive away from my grandma’s house, my dad has been coming here for longer than I’ve been alive. Well, my mom carries one or two year old me into the Pandaria; overtaken by the sweet smell of pondulse, the loud voices speaking so fast in spanish all I comprehended was their happy tone and laughter, the crinkling of wax paper as the Senora behind the counter packaged a sugary bread up, I individually pointed to every single piece of pondulse and said, “Ya… ya…ya.” Well, given that there were most likely a couple thousand pieces in that given bakery, and although they only cost about a dollar each we couldn’t realistically consume them all, I sat down in the middle of the floor and started crying. Maybe I can’t always be in LA with my dad’s side of the family, where my abuelita used to live. Maybe I can’t always feel fully included in my father’s culture, can’t grow up around it; one thing I do have, however, and one thing that New York City can provide me with, is the familiar bakeries I know of as Pandarias.</p>
        <p>The remarkable thing about NYC, what makes it so special to people of different backgrounds, is the condensing of different cultures mashed into one small city; hence, the term, “melting pot.” Different areas in the city manifest themselves into compact regions of a specific people and culture. Sunset Park, exhibiting, in my experience, the neighborhood most distinctly packed with Mexican culture, is a region very special to me. Walking into a Sunset Park Pandaria, you can tell from the highly decorated walls with various memorabilia and religious items, the images of families and traditional bands or soccer teams, that this is a place where someone’s culture is being reflected. This very distinct scene of immigration, one culture not assimilated into another,  is what makes these places so special to me.</p>
        <p> Culture is such an interesting word. It is clearly defined what it means to be of one race, to be biracial, to genetically fit into one group. But how does one categorize the customs, the ways of life of their people when they don’t even know exactly who their people are?  In many ways, at least from the perspective of my father’s lineage, I have for the most part assimilated into my mother’s culture. My dad married a white Jewish woman, raising their two happy children in the heart of Park Slope. Physically, I don’t look anything like my dad; growing up going to a Park Slope elementary school, other moms and even classmates of mine always assumed he was my babysitter (whether this is vaguely offensive or not, I still haven’t fully processed). We live blocks away from my mom’s parents and sister; I’m super close with this side of my family, in contrast to the once a year visit we have with my dad’s side. I’m not saying I love them any less, I just honestly don’t really know them as well. My dad always talks about how his aunts and uncles houses used to always be full with his family, the cousins all running around, people piling their plates high with food in the kitchen. I love hearing these stories, and like any good story, I often wish I could just jump inside and experience it; I wish I was able to experience that side of my family the way my father did. I love little things like Panaderias that let me taste a little part of my dad’s side.</p>
